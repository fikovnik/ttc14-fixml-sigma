\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

%% Overview
In this paper we describe our solution for the \TTC \FIXML case study~\cite{Lano2014} using the \SIGMA internal DSLs~\cite{Krikava2014}.
In addition to solving the core tasks that consists of generating Java, \Csharp and C++ code from \FIXML messages structure, we also solve all the proposed extensions for determining appropriate types of element attributes, generating C code and generic \FIXML schema transformation.
Our solution supports array generation for multiple sibling XML nodes that share the same name, and most notably it generates proper constructor calls, keeping the initial values as they occur in the XML document.
Purposely, we choose a non-trivial object-oriented model in order to demonstrate that \SIGMA can be easily applied in complex transformations.
Finally, for all target languages, the generated code is complete, including all necessary statements so it compiles without any problems or warning\footnote{Tested using OpenJDK 1.7, Mono 3.2 and Clang 6.0 on OSX 10.9}.

%% Scala
The solution was developed in \SIGMA, a family of Scala\footnote{\url{http://scala-lang.org}} internal DSLs for model manipulation tasks such as model validation, model to model (M2M), and model to text (M2T) transformations.
Scala is a statically typed production-ready \emph{General-Purpose Language} (GPL) that supports both object-oriented and functional styles of programming.
It uses type inference to combine static type safety with a \emph{``look and feel''} close to dynamically typed languages.
% It is interoperable with Java and has been designed to host internal DSLs~\cite{Chafi2010}.
% Furthermore, it is supported by the major integrated development environments.
%% SIGMA
\SIGMA DSLs are embedded in Scala as a library allowing one to manipulate models using high-level constructs similar to the ones found in the external model manipulation DSLs such as ETL or ATL~\footnote{Epsilon $-$ \url{https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/}, ATL $-$ \url{https://www.eclipse.org/atl/}}.
The intent is to provide an approach that developers can use to implement many of the practical model manipulations within a familiar environment, with a reduced learning overhead as well as improved usability and performance.
The solution is based on the \emph{Eclipse Modeling Framework} (EMF), which is a popular meta-modeling framework widely used in both academia and industry, and which is directly supported by \SIGMA.

%% Organization
% We first describe the solution to the case study core problem, then the solution for the extensions followed by an evaluation conclusion.
% The appendix provides additional code listings for the reader to get further details.
The complete source code is available on Github as well as directly runnable from a SHARE environment\footnote{Github $-$ \url{http://bit.ly/1mHSCHY}, SHARE $-$ \url{http://bit.ly/1sSWDeB}}.
